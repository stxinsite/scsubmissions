We use stxexpfpga01 as a head node and compilation machine,
It also has two older Bittware 520N FPGAs plugged in, which we are no longer
using since they have only 40 Gbps links

We use stxexpfpga02 as the FPGA node.  It has four Bittware 520N-MX cards with 100 Gbps links,

the -environment files are the output from the SC provided collect-environment.sh file (copied here)

the -fpga files are the output from the Intel FPGA SDK command "aocl list-devices"

FPGA support software changes rapidly.  We have multiple versions installed and the work in the paper was done with IntelFPGA_pro 19.3 installed as /zfs/intelFPGA_pro/19.3/

Version information for the board support package is
